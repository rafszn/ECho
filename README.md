ECHO - Audio File Uploader 

This is a React application that allows users to upload audio files to a backend server for processing. The backend server, implemented using Node.js with Express, accepts audio file uploads and uses Multer middleware to handle file uploads and OpenAI API (specifically Whisper from OpenAI) for transcribing the audio to text.

FEATURES
- Upload audio files in various formats (e.g., mp3, wav) from the frontend
- Transcribe the audio file to text using OpenAI's Whisper API
- Display the transcribed text on the frontend

TECHNOLOGIS USED
- React.js: Frontend development
- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js
- Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js
- Axios: HTTP client for making requests from the frontend to the backend
- OpenAI API: Specifically Whisper for transcribing audio to text
